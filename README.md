# Runwrap
![https://github.com/PaprikaX33/runwrap/actions/workflows/rust_check.yml](https://github.com/PaprikaX33/runwrap/actions/workflows/rust-check.yml/badge.svg)
A wrapper for `unwrap` and `expect` to make it easier to determine whether its a real `unwrap` / `expect` or a temporary hack during prototyping.

## Notes
This project is just a plain wrapper or alias for `unwrap` and `expect` to have a distinc name to make it easier when transitioning from a quick prototype with `unwrap` and `expect` as a workaround to proper error handling
